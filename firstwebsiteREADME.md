2. Give it a name (which will be part of the URL) and optional description. Leave it set to “Public.” Click the green button.
3. Ignore everything on this page except for the light blue box at the top (quick setup). Click on the link “upload an existing file.”
4. Drag something from your computer or select a file to add. The main page for the repository/project should be named “index.html” always. Click the green “Commit changes” button.
